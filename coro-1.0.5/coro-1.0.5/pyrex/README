This directory contains a collection of generic Pyrex include files.
Do not put any pyrex modules in here.

Note: early in Shrapnel's history, we built our own 'libc.pxd' and 'python.pxi' files
that eventually made their way into the Pyrex/Cython distribution, and have since been
split into separate 'packages' (e.g., libc.string.memcpy).  What remains here should
truly be either platform or shrapnel-specific.
